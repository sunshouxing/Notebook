Any previously scheduled alarm is canceled (only one alarm can be scheduled at any time). The returned value is then the number of seconds before any previously set alarm was to have been delivered. If time is zero, no alarm is scheduled, and any scheduled alarm is canceled. If the return value is zero, no alarm is currently scheduled. (See the Unix man page alarm(2).) Availability: Unix.\n",

    "Here is a minimal example program. It uses the alarm() function to limit the time spent waiting to sleep; this is useful if you are worry about sleeping too long. The solution is to set a 5-second alarm before sleeping; if you sleeps too long, the alarm signal will be sent, and the handler raises an exception."
