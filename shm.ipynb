    "To be even extreme, you may drop or disable this temporarily RAM-based filesystem entirely, to prevent it from auto-mount during system boots up, if none of the application in that Linux server relying on shared memory function or explicitly using tmpfs (as a quick-and-dirty trick to improve execution performance).\n",
