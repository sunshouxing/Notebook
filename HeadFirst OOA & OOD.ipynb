    "    -  Software development is always iterative.  You look at the big picture, and then iterate down to smaller pieces of functionality.  \n",
    "    -  You have to do analysis and design at each step of your development cycle, including when you start working on a new feature or use case.  \n",

    "    - Class are about behavior and functionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - **DRY**: Avoid duplicate codes by abstracting out things that are common and placing them in a single location.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **SRP**: Every object in your system should have a single responsibility, and all the object's services should be focus on carry out that single reponsibiltiy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **LSP**: Subclasses should be suitable for the base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bullet Points**\n",
    "    - The Open-Closed Principle keeps your software reusable, but still flexible, by keeping classes open for extension, but closed for modification.  \n",
    "    - With classes doing one single thing through the Single Responsibility Principle, it’s even easier to apply the OCP to your code.  \n",
    "    - When you’re trying to determine if a method is the responsibility of a class, ask yourself, Is it this class’s job to do this particular thing? If not, move the method to another class.  \n",
    "    - Once you have your OO code nearly complete, be sure that you Don’t Repeat Yourself. You’ll avoid duplicate code, and ensure that each behavior in your code is in a single place.  \n",
    "    - DRY applies to requirements as well as your code: you should have each feature and requirement in your software implemented in a single place.  \n",
    "    - The Liskov Substitution Principle ensures that you use inheritance correctly, by requiring that subtypes be substitutable for their base types.  \n",
    "    - When you find code that violates the LSP, consider using delegation, composition, or aggregation to use behavior from other classes without resorting to inheritance.  \n",
    "    - If you need behavior from another class but don’t need to change or modify that behavior, you can simply delegate to that class to use the desired behavior.  \n",
    "    - Composition lets you choose a behavior from a family of behaviors, often via several implementations of an interface.  \n",
    "    - When you use composition, the composing object owns the behaviors it uses, and they stop existing as soon as the composing object does.  \n",
    "    - Aggregation allows you to use behaviors from another class without limiting the lifetime to those behaviors.  \n",
    "    - Aggregated behaviors continue to exist even after the aggregating object is destroyed.\n",
