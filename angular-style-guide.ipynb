    "# Angular 1 Style Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Angular Team Endorsed\n",
    "Special thanks to Igor Minar, lead on the Angular team, for reviewing, contributing feedback, and entrusting me to shepherd this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "*Opinionated Angular style guide for teams by [@john_papa](//twitter.com/john_papa)*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring Angular applications, then step right in. These styles are based on my development experience with [Angular](//angularjs.org), presentations, [Pluralsight training courses](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/john-papa) and working in teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If you like this guide, check out my [Angular Patterns: Clean Code](http://jpapa.me/ngclean) course at Pluralsight which is a companion to this guide.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Community Awesomeness and Credit\n",
    "Never work in a vacuum. I find that the Angular community is an incredible group who are passionate about sharing experiences. As such, Angular expert Todd Motto and I have collaborated on many styles and conventions. We agree on most, and some we diverge. I encourage you to check out [Todd's guidelines](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide) to get a sense for his approach and how it compares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of my styles have been from the many pair programming sessions [Ward Bell](https://twitter.com/wardbell) and I have had. My friend Ward has certainly helped influence the ultimate evolution of this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## See the Styles in a Sample App\n",
    "While this guide explains the *what*, *why* and *how*, I find it helpful to see them in practice. This guide is accompanied by a sample application that follows these styles and patterns. You can find the [sample application (named modular) here](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos) in the `modular` folder. Feel free to grab it, clone it, or fork it. [Instructions on running it are in its readme](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos/tree/master/modular).\n",

    "### Rule of 1\n",
    "###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: One component per file promotes easier unit testing and mocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid collisions with teams in source control.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The following example defines the `app` module and its dependencies, defines a controller, and defines a factory all in the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app', ['ngRoute'])\n",
    "      .controller('SomeController', SomeController)\n",
    "      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);\n",
    "\n",
    "  function SomeController() { }\n",
    "\n",
    "  function someFactory() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  The same components are now separated into their own files.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended */\n",
    "\n",
    "  // app.module.js\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app', ['ngRoute']);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended */\n",
    "\n",
    "  // some.controller.js\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);\n",
    "\n",
    "  function SomeController() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",

    "  function someFactory() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small Functions\n",
    "###### [Style [Y002](#style-y002)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to test, especially when they do one thing and serve one purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Small functions promote reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Small functions help avoid hidden bugs that come with large functions that share variables with external scope, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## IIFE\n",
    "### JavaScript Scopes\n",
    "###### [Style [Y010](#style-y010)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Wrap Angular components in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope, which also helps avoid variable collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  // logger.js\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .factory('logger', logger);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // logger function is added as a global variable\n",
    "  function logger() { }\n",
    "\n",
    "  // storage.js\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .factory('storage', storage);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // storage function is added as a global variable\n",
    "  function storage() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /**\n",
    "   * recommended\n",
    "   *\n",
    "   * no globals are left behind\n",
    "   */\n",
    "\n",
    "  // logger.js\n",
    "  (function() {\n",
    "      'use strict';\n",
    "\n",
    "      angular\n",
    "          .module('app')\n",
    "          .factory('logger', logger);\n",
    "\n",
    "      function logger() { }\n",
    "  })();\n",
    "\n",
    "  // storage.js\n",
    "  (function() {\n",
    "      'use strict';\n",
    "\n",
    "      angular\n",
    "          .module('app')\n",
    "          .factory('storage', storage);\n",
    "\n",
    "      function storage() { }\n",
    "  })();\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Note: For brevity only, the rest of the examples in this guide may omit the IIFE syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Note: IIFE's prevent test code from reaching private members like regular expressions or helper functions which are often good to unit test directly on their own. However you can test these through accessible members or by exposing them through their own component. For example placing helper functions, regular expressions or constants in their own factory or constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid Naming Collisions\n",
    "###### [Style [Y020](#style-y020)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. For example `app` may be your root module while `app.dashboard` and `app.users` may be modules that are used as dependencies of `app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions (aka Setters)\n",
    "###### [Style [Y021](#style-y021)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: With 1 component per file, there is rarely a need to introduce a variable for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  var app = angular.module('app', [\n",
    "      'ngAnimate',\n",
    "      'ngRoute',\n",
    "      'app.shared',\n",
    "      'app.dashboard'\n",
    "  ]);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Instead use the simple setter syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended */\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app', [\n",
    "          'ngAnimate',\n",
    "          'ngRoute',\n",
    "          'app.shared',\n",
    "          'app.dashboard'\n",
    "      ]);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getters\n",
    "###### [Style [Y022](#style-y022)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - When using a module, avoid using a variable and instead use chaining with the getter syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: This produces more readable code and avoids variable collisions or leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  var app = angular.module('app');\n",
    "  app.controller('SomeController', SomeController);\n",
    "\n",
    "  function SomeController() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended */\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);\n",
    "\n",
    "  function SomeController() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting vs Getting\n",
    "###### [Style [Y023](#style-y023)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Only set once and get for all other instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: A module should only be created once, then retrieved from that point and after.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended */\n",
    "\n",
    "  // to set a module\n",
    "  angular.module('app', []);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // to get a module\n",
    "  angular.module('app');\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named vs Anonymous Functions\n",
    "###### [Style [Y024](#style-y024)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use named functions instead of passing an anonymous function in as a callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: This produces more readable code, is much easier to debug, and reduces the amount of nested callback code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .controller('DashboardController', function() { })\n",
    "      .factory('logger', function() { });\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended */\n",
    "\n",
    "  // dashboard.js\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .controller('DashboardController', DashboardController);\n",
    "\n",
    "  function DashboardController() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  // logger.js\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .factory('logger', logger);\n",
    "\n",
    "  function logger() { }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "### controllerAs View Syntax\n",
    "###### [Style [Y030](#style-y030)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use the [`controllerAs`](http://www.johnpapa.net/do-you-like-your-angular-controllers-with-or-without-sugar/) syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Controllers are constructed, \"newed\" up, and provide a single new instance, and the `controllerAs` syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the `classic $scope syntax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: It promotes the use of binding to a \"dotted\" object in the View (e.g. `customer.name` instead of `name`), which is more contextual, easier to read, and avoids any reference issues that may occur without \"dotting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Helps avoid using `$parent` calls in Views with nested controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```html\n",
    "  <!-- avoid -->\n",
    "  <div ng-controller=\"CustomerController\">\n",
    "      {{ name }}\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```html\n",
    "  <!-- recommended -->\n",
    "  <div ng-controller=\"CustomerController as customer\">\n",
    "      {{ customer.name }}\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### controllerAs Controller Syntax\n",
    "###### [Style [Y031](#style-y031)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use the `controllerAs` syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The `controllerAs` syntax uses `this` inside controllers which gets bound to `$scope`\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: `controllerAs` is syntactic sugar over `$scope`. You can still bind to the View and still access `$scope` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: Helps avoid the temptation of using `$scope` methods inside a controller when it may otherwise be better to avoid them or move the method to a factory, and reference them from the controller. Consider using `$scope` in a controller only when needed. For example when publishing and subscribing events using [`$emit`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$emit), [`$broadcast`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$broadcast), or [`$on`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$on).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  function CustomerController($scope) {\n",
    "      $scope.name = {};\n",
    "      $scope.sendMessage = function() { };\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended - but see next section */\n",
    "  function CustomerController() {\n",
    "      this.name = {};\n",
    "      this.sendMessage = function() { };\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### controllerAs with vm\n",
    "###### [Style [Y032](#style-y032)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use a capture variable for `this` when using the `controllerAs` syntax. Choose a consistent variable name such as `vm`, which stands for ViewModel.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Why?*: The `this` keyword is contextual and when used within a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing the context of `this` avoids encountering this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  function CustomerController() {\n",
    "      this.name = {};\n",
    "      this.sendMessage = function() { };\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* recommended */\n",
    "  function CustomerController() {\n",
    "      var vm = this;\n",
    "      vm.name = {};\n",
    "      vm.sendMessage = function() { };\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note: You can avoid any [jshint](http://jshint.com/) warnings by placing the comment above the line of code. However it is not needed when the function is named using UpperCasing, as this convention means it is a constructor function, which is what a controller is in Angular.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* jshint validthis: true */\n",
    "  var vm = this;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note: When creating watches in a controller using `controller as`, you can watch the `vm.*` member using the following syntax. (Create watches with caution as they add more load to the digest cycle.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```html\n",
    "  <input ng-model=\"vm.title\"/>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  function SomeController($scope, $log) {\n",
    "      var vm = this;\n",
    "      vm.title = 'Some Title';\n",
    "\n",
    "      $scope.$watch('vm.title', function(current, original) {\n",
    "          $log.info('vm.title was %s', original);\n",
    "          $log.info('vm.title is now %s', current);\n",
    "      });\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note: When working with larger codebases, using a more descriptive name can help ease cognitive overhead & searchability. Avoid overly verbose names that are cumbersome to type.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```html\n",
    "  <!-- avoid -->\n",
    "  <input ng-model=\"customerProductItemVm.title\">\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bindable Members Up Top\n",
    "###### [Style [Y033](#style-y033)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Setting anonymous functions in-line can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability. Defining the functions below the bindable members (the functions will be hoisted) moves the implementation details down, keeps the bindable members up top, and makes it easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  /* avoid */\n",
    "  function SessionsController() {\n",
    "      var vm = this;\n",

    "### Manipulate DOM in a Directive\n",
    "###### [Style [Y072](#style-y072)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - When manipulating the DOM directly, use a directive. If alternative ways can be used such as using CSS to set styles or the [animation services](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate), Angular templating, [`ngShow`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow) or [`ngHide`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide), then use those instead. For example, if the directive simply hides and shows, use ngHide/ngShow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: DOM manipulation can be difficult to test, debug, and there are often better ways (e.g. CSS, animations, templates)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provide a Unique Directive Prefix\n",
    "###### [Style [Y073](#style-y073)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Provide a short, unique and descriptive directive prefix such as `acmeSalesCustomerInfo` which would be declared in HTML as `acme-sales-customer-info`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: The unique short prefix identifies the directive's context and origin. For example a prefix of `cc-` may indicate that the directive is part of a CodeCamper app while `acme-` may indicate a directive for the Acme company.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: Avoid `ng-` as these are reserved for Angular directives. Research widely used directives to avoid naming conflicts, such as `ion-` for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).\n",

    "###### [Style [Y074](#style-y074)]\n",

Generally, if it could be its own control, `E` is appropriate. General guideline is allow `EA` but lean towards implementing as an element when it's stand-alone and as an attribute when it enhances its existing DOM element.\n",

Using a [route resolve](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/provider/$routeProvider) allows the promise to resolve before the controller logic executes, so it might take action based on that data from the promise.\n",

If the team cannot find the files they need to work on quickly, they will not be able to work as efficiently as possible, and the structure needs to change. You may not know the file name or where its related files are, so putting them in the most intuitive locations and near each other saves a ton of time. A descriptive folder structure can help with this.\n",

    "###### [Style [Y142](#style-y142)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - When you look at a file you should instantly know what it contains and represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: You spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. If this means you want longer file names, then so be it. Be descriptive with file names and keeping the contents of the file to exactly 1 component. Avoid files with multiple controllers, multiple services, or a mixture. There are deviations of the 1 per file rule when I have a set of very small features that are all related to each other, they are still easily identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flat\n",
    "###### [Style [Y143](#style-y143)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Keep a flat folder structure as long as possible. When you get to 7+ files, begin considering separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Nobody wants to search 7 levels of folders to find a file. Think about menus on web sites … anything deeper than 2 should take serious consideration. In a folder structure there is no hard and fast number rule, but when a folder has 7-10 files, that may be time to create subfolders. Base it on your comfort level. Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value (to help the rest of LIFT) in creating a new folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Being DRY is important, but not crucial if it sacrifices the others in LIFT, which is why I call it T-DRY. I don’t want to type session-view.html for a view because, well, it’s obviously a view. If it is not obvious or by convention, then I name it.\n",

    "### Overall Guidelines\n",
    "###### [Style [Y150](#style-y150)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. In other words, start small but keep in mind on where the app is heading down the road. All of the app's code goes in a root folder named `app`. All content is 1 feature per file. Each controller, service, module, view is in its own file. All 3rd party vendor scripts are stored in another root folder and not in the `app` folder. I didn't write them and I don't want them cluttering my app (`bower_components`, `scripts`, `lib`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: Find more details and reasoning behind the structure at [this original post on application structure](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-app-structuring-guidelines/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layout\n",
    "###### [Style [Y151](#style-y151)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Place components that define the overall layout of the application in a folder named `layout`. These may include a shell view and controller may act as the container for the app, navigation, menus, content areas, and other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Organizes all layout in a single place re-used throughout the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folders-by-Feature Structure\n",
    "###### [Style [Y152](#style-y152)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: A developer can locate the code, identify what each file represents at a glance, the structure is flat as can be, and there is no repetitive nor redundant names.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: The LIFT guidelines are all covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Helps reduce the app from becoming cluttered through organizing the content and keeping them aligned with the LIFT guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: When there are a lot of files (10+) locating them is easier with a consistent folder structures and more difficult in flat structures.\n",

    "## Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Many Small, Self Contained Modules\n",
    "###### [Style [Y160](#style-y160)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Modular applications make it easy to plug and go as they allow the development teams to build vertical slices of the applications and roll out incrementally. This means we can plug in new features as we develop them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create an App Module\n",
    "###### [Style [Y161](#style-y161)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create an application root module whose role is to pull together all of the modules and features of your application. Name this for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Angular encourages modularity and separation patterns. Creating an application root module whose role is to tie your other modules together provides a very straightforward way to add or remove modules from your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep the App Module Thin\n",
    "###### [Style [Y162](#style-y162)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Only put logic for pulling together the app in the application module. Leave features in their own modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Adding additional roles to the application root to get remote data, display views, or other logic not related to pulling the app together muddies the app module and make both sets of features harder to reuse or turn off.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: The app module becomes a manifest that describes which modules help define the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Areas are Modules\n",
    "###### [Style [Y163](#style-y163)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create modules that represent feature areas, such as layout, reusable and shared services, dashboards, and app specific features (e.g. customers, admin, sales).\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Self contained modules can be added to the application with little or no friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Sprints or iterations can focus on feature areas and turn them on at the end of the sprint or iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Separating feature areas into modules makes it easier to test the modules in isolation and reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reusable Blocks are Modules\n",
    "###### [Style [Y164](#style-y164)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create modules that represent reusable application blocks for common services such as exception handling, logging, diagnostics, security, and local data stashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: These types of features are needed in many applications, so by keeping them separated in their own modules they can be application generic and be reused across applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module Dependencies\n",
    "###### [Style [Y165](#style-y165)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The application root module depends on the app specific feature modules and any shared or reusable modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Modularity and Dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/modularity-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: The main app module contains a quickly identifiable manifest of the application's features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Each feature area contains a manifest of what it depends on, so it can be pulled in as a dependency in other applications and still work.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Intra-App features such as shared data services become easy to locate and share from within `app.core` (choose your favorite name for this module).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: This is a strategy for consistency. There are many good options here. Choose one that is consistent, follows Angular's dependency rules, and is easy to maintain and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > My structures vary slightly between projects but they all follow these guidelines for structure and modularity. The implementation may vary depending on the features and the team. In other words, don't get hung up on an exact like-for-like structure but do justify your structure using consistency, maintainability, and efficiency in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > In a small app, you can also consider putting all the shared dependencies in the app module where the feature modules have no direct dependencies. This makes it easier to maintain the smaller application, but makes it harder to reuse modules outside of this application.\n",

    "## Startup Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "###### [Style [Y170](#style-y170)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Inject code into [module configuration](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module#module-loading-dependencies) that must be configured before running the angular app. Ideal candidates include providers and constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: This makes it easier to have less places for configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .config(configure);\n",
    "\n",
    "  configure.$inject =\n",
    "      ['routerHelperProvider', 'exceptionHandlerProvider', 'toastr'];\n",
    "\n",
    "  function configure (routerHelperProvider, exceptionHandlerProvider, toastr) {\n",
    "      exceptionHandlerProvider.configure(config.appErrorPrefix);\n",
    "      configureStateHelper();\n",
    "\n",
    "      toastr.options.timeOut = 4000;\n",
    "      toastr.options.positionClass = 'toast-bottom-right';\n",

    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Blocks\n",
    "###### [Style [Y171](#style-y171)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Any code that needs to run when an application starts should be declared in a factory, exposed via a function, and injected into the [run block](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module#module-loading-dependencies). \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Consider using manual bootstrapping techniques, as an alternative for logic that must run prior to running the Angular app.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Code directly in a run block can be difficult to test. Placing in a factory makes it easier to abstract and mock.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Code directly in a run block can cause race conditions for startup logic, as it does not have a way to communicate when asynchronous code in the run block has completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  angular\n",
    "      .module('app')\n",
    "      .run(runBlock);\n",
    "\n",
    "  runBlock.$inject = ['authenticator', 'translator'];\n",

    "\n",
    "### $document and $window\n",
    "###### [Style [Y180](#style-y180)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use [`$document`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$document) and [`$window`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$window) instead of `document` and `window`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable than using document and window in tests. This helps you avoid having to mock document and window yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $timeout and $interval\n",
    "###### [Style [Y181](#style-y181)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use [`$timeout`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout) and [`$interval`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$interval) instead of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` .\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable and handle Angular's digest cycle thus keeping data binding in sync.\n",

    "### Write Tests with Stories\n",
    "###### [Style [Y190](#style-y190)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Write a set of tests for every story. Start with an empty test and fill them in as you write the code for the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Writing the test descriptions helps clearly define what your story will do, will not do, and how you can measure success.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    it('should have Avengers controller', function() {\n",

    "### Testing Library\n",
    "###### [Style [Y191](#style-y191)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) or [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) for unit testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Both Jasmine and Mocha are widely used in the Angular community. Both are stable, well maintained, and provide robust testing features.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Test Runner\n",
    "###### [Style [Y192](#style-y192)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) as a test runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Karma is easy to configure to run once or automatically when you change your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Karma hooks into your Continuous Integration process easily on its own or through Grunt or Gulp.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Some IDE's are beginning to integrate with Karma, such as [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/02f47876-0e7a-4f6c-93f8-1af5d5189225).\n",

    "  - Use [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for stubbing and spying.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Sinon works well with both Jasmine and Mocha and extends the stubbing and spying features they offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Sinon makes it easier to toggle between Jasmine and Mocha, if you want to try both.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Sinon has descriptive messages when tests fail the assertions.\n",

    "### Headless Browser\n",
    "###### [Style [Y194](#style-y194)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) to run your tests on a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: PhantomJS is a headless browser that helps run your tests without needing a \"visual\" browser. So you do not have to install Chrome, Safari, IE, or other browsers on your server.\n",

    "    ```javascript\n",

    "###### [Style [Y197](#style-y197)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Place unit test files (specs) side-by-side with your client code. Place specs that cover server integration or test multiple components in a separate `tests` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Unit tests have a direct correlation to a specific component and file in source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: It is easier to keep them up to date since they are always in sight. When coding whether you do TDD or test during development or test after development, the specs are side-by-side and never out of sight nor mind, and thus more likely to be maintained which also helps maintain code coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: When you update source code it is easier to go update the tests at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Placing them side-by-side makes it easy to find them and easy to move them with the source code if you move the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Having the spec nearby makes it easier for the source code reader to learn how the component is supposed to be used and to discover its known limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Separating specs so they are not in a distributed build is easy with grunt or gulp.\n",

    "### Usage\n",
    "###### [Style [Y210](#style-y210)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use subtle [animations with Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/animations) to transition between states for views and primary visual elements. Include the [ngAnimate module](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate). The 3 keys are subtle, smooth, seamless.\n",

    "    *Why?*: Subtle animations can improve perceived performance as views transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub Second\n",
    "###### [Style [Y211](#style-y211)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use short durations for animations. I generally start with 300ms and adjust until appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Long animations can have the reverse effect on User Experience and perceived performance by giving the appearance of a slow application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### animate.css\n",
    "###### [Style [Y212](#style-y212)]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for conventional animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: The animations that animate.css provides are fast, smooth, and easy to add to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: Provides consistency in your animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why?*: animate.css is widely used and tested.\n",
